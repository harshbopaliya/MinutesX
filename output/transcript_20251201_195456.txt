Sarah Chen: Good morning everyone, thank you for joining our Q1 product planning session. I know we all have busy schedules, so let's make this meeting productive. We have a lot to cover today including our mobile performance issues, the onboarding redesign initiative, and the API project for enterprise customers. John, could you kick us off with the engineering metrics from last quarter?

John Martinez: Thanks Sarah. So looking at our Q4 numbers, we shipped twelve features which was above our target of ten. However, I want to highlight some concerns. Our Android crash rate has increased to two point five percent, which is significantly above our target of one percent. This is affecting our app store rating which dropped from four point six to four point three stars. Additionally, we're seeing elevated API latency during peak hours, averaging around three hundred milliseconds when we should be under two hundred.

Sarah Chen: That's concerning. Mike, you've been investigating the crash issues. What have you found?

Mike Thompson: Yes, I spent the last two weeks analyzing the crash reports. The main culprit is memory management on older Android devices, specifically those running Android ten or earlier with less than four gigabytes of RAM. When users have multiple data sources connected, we're seeing out-of-memory crashes during the sync process. I believe we can implement a chunked synchronization approach that would reduce memory usage by about sixty percent.

Sarah Chen: How long would that fix take to implement?

Mike Thompson: With focused effort, I could have a fix ready by January fifteenth. However, this would mean pushing back the real-time collaboration feature that was scheduled for this sprint.

John Martinez: I think that's the right trade-off. User retention is more critical than new features right now.

Sarah Chen: Agreed. Mike, the crash fix is your top priority. John, please update the sprint plan and communicate the delay on real-time collaboration to stakeholders.

Lisa Wang: Can I jump in here? I've been reviewing our user analytics and I'm seeing a concerning pattern with our onboarding flow. We have a forty percent drop-off rate at step three of the onboarding process. That's where users need to connect their first data source. The interface is confusing and the instructions aren't clear enough.

David Kim: I can add some context to that. I ran an analysis comparing users who complete onboarding versus those who don't. Users who successfully connect at least one data source have a three hundred percent higher thirty-day retention rate. So this is really a major opportunity for us.

Sarah Chen: Lisa, what's your proposed solution?

Lisa Wang: I want to redesign the onboarding into a simplified three-step wizard. First, we show a preview of what the connected experience looks like. Second, we guide them through connecting their most common data source, which based on David's data is Google Sheets at forty-two percent of users. Third, we immediately show them their first insight so they get that aha moment quickly.

Sarah Chen: I like that approach. What resources do you need?

Lisa Wang: I'll need about a week for mockups and user testing. Then Mike's team would need approximately two weeks for implementation.

Mike Thompson: I could have that ready by February first if we start the design phase this week.

Sarah Chen: Let's do it. Lisa, have your mockups ready for review by January tenth. Set up a design review meeting with John and Mike. David, I need you to create a detailed funnel analysis report by Thursday so I can present it to the executive team.

David Kim: Will do. I'll also segment the data by acquisition channel so we can identify if certain marketing sources are bringing in users who struggle more with onboarding.

John Martinez: Speaking of resources, I want to bring up the technical debt discussion. We've been putting off some important infrastructure work and it's starting to affect our velocity. Our authentication system is using deprecated libraries, and our test coverage for critical paths has dropped to sixty-five percent.

Sarah Chen: What's your recommendation?

John Martinez: I'd like to allocate twenty percent of our sprint capacity to technical debt for Q1. This would mean about one developer per sprint focused on infrastructure improvements, automated testing, and documentation.

Mike Thompson: I strongly support this. We're accumulating shortcuts that will cost us more in the long run.

Sarah Chen: Approved. John, incorporate this into sprint planning starting immediately. Make sure we're tracking the specific technical debt items and their business impact.

John Martinez: Perfect. I'll set up a technical debt backlog in Jira and we'll review it during our bi-weekly engineering sync.

Sarah Chen: Now let's discuss the API initiative. We've received requests from three enterprise customers for programmatic access to our platform. John, what's the scope of work for a minimum viable API?

John Martinez: We've done a preliminary assessment. For a basic read-only API covering dashboards, data exports, and user management, we're looking at about six weeks of development time. Adding write capabilities would extend that to ten weeks. We'd also need to consider rate limiting, authentication tokens, and documentation.

Sarah Chen: Can we have something in beta by end of Q1?

Mike Thompson: If we scope it to read-only endpoints and basic authentication, yes. We could have a beta ready by late March with proper security review.

Sarah Chen: Let's plan for that. John, assign Priya to lead the API project. She has experience with API design from her previous role. Make sure she connects with the enterprise customers early to validate our endpoint design.

John Martinez: Will do. I'll have her start with a technical specification document and share it with the team by end of next week.

Lisa Wang: One more thing I wanted to mention. I've been getting requests from the marketing team for updated product screenshots and demo videos. Should we prioritize that given the UI changes coming?

Sarah Chen: Good point. Let's wait until after the onboarding redesign is complete. We can schedule a marketing asset refresh in late February.

David Kim: I can help with that. I've been learning some video editing tools and could create some simple product walkthrough videos.

Sarah Chen: That would be great, David. Let's add that to your Q1 objectives.

John Martinez: Before we wrap up, I want to confirm our weekly sync schedule. Are we still meeting Tuesdays at ten AM?

Sarah Chen: Yes, let's keep that. But I'd also like to add a brief Thursday check-in, just fifteen minutes, to catch any blockers early.

Mike Thompson: Works for me. Should we use Slack for async updates in between?

Sarah Chen: Absolutely. Let's create a dedicated channel for Q1 planning updates. John, can you set that up?

John Martinez: I'll create it right after this meeting.

Sarah Chen: Excellent. Let me summarize our action items and decisions. First, Mike will focus on fixing the Android crash issues with a target completion date of January fifteenth. Second, Lisa will prepare onboarding redesign mockups by January tenth for our design review. Third, David will deliver the funnel analysis report by Thursday for the executive presentation. Fourth, John will allocate twenty percent of sprint capacity to technical debt and set up the tracking system. Fifth, Priya will lead the API development project targeting a March beta release. Sixth, we'll hold weekly syncs on Tuesdays with short Thursday check-ins. Are there any questions or concerns?

Lisa Wang: Just to confirm, should I schedule the design review meeting for January eleventh?

Sarah Chen: That works. Include John, Mike, and myself. David, you're welcome to join as well for the analytics perspective.

David Kim: I'll be there.

John Martinez: One quick note. We should probably loop in security for the API project early. I'll schedule an initial consultation with the security team.

Sarah Chen: Good thinking. Add that to Priya's kickoff tasks.

Mike Thompson: Also, regarding the crash fix, I may need to borrow some QA resources for testing on various Android devices. John, can we discuss that offline?

John Martinez: Sure, let's sync right after this call.

Sarah Chen: Perfect. Thank you all for your input today. This is shaping up to be an important quarter for our product. Let's execute on these priorities and reconvene in two weeks for our progress review. Meeting adjourned.

John Martinez: Thanks everyone.

Lisa Wang: Thanks Sarah. Great meeting.

Mike Thompson: See you all at the Tuesday sync.

David Kim: Thanks team. I'll have that report ready by Thursday.
